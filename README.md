# Google Play Store Apps Analysis

## Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis on a dataset from the Google Play Store. The primary goal is to derive insights about various app attributes such as pricing, genre distribution, ratings, and reviews. This analysis helps in understanding trends and patterns in the app market.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes various features such as app names, categories, ratings, reviews, size, installs, type (free/paid), price, content rating, genres, and last updated date.

## Objectives

- Identify the most expensive apps on the Play Store.
- Determine which genre has the most apps.
- Analyze the relationship between app ratings and the number of reviews.
- Explore the distribution of apps across different price ranges.
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:**
   - Loaded the dataset and performed initial exploration to understand the data structure and contents.
  
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values, fixed data type inconsistencies, and cleaned specific columns like reviews and price.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized key trends and patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
   - Answered specific questions related to the most expensive apps, genre distribution, and rating trends.

4. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Applied statistical techniques to analyze correlations between different app features.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python:** Main programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Numerical computations.
- **Seaborn:** Data visualization.
- **Matplotlib:** Plotting and visualization.

## Results

- Identified the most expensive apps and analyzed their characteristics.
- Found that certain genres dominate the Play Store in terms of the number of apps.
- Established a correlation between app ratings and the number of reviews.
